## ✋ About Me 
Hi! I'm César, but, I call myself **Yuu**. I'm currently a Junior Dev, but like people say: *"The best part of an adventure is the journey."*  
Since I'm a young dev, I've been committed to growing, learning, and reaching new goals until I become a Senior Dev.

I'm a Fullstack Developer with a strong interest in Backend development — although I'm always sharpening my skills in both ends of Web Development.

### 🎮 Hobbies
Ever since I was a kid, I've loved video games. They were actually one of the main reasons I got into coding — I was fascinated by the logic behind them.  
In my free time, I enjoy taking online courses, watching anime, reading manga, and soon... books too!
